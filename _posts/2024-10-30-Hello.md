Adding `rbx` to `rcx` gives the desired result.

What is ```rust fn main()``` in Rust would be ```c int main()``` in C.

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello World!");
}
```

This has ``` `backticks` ``` in it (but the spaces are trimmed). And ``` here```
the leading space is also trimmed.

$\sum_i \binom{n}{i} = 2^n$

$$
  \sum_i \binom{n}{i} = 2^n
$$

文本之间的公式 $\sum_i \binom{n}{i} = 2^n$。
